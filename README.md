# Epigenetic Clock

**Status:** ðŸ”’ In Progress - This project is currently under development, and the full data and analysis will be made available upon completion.

## Project overview
This project focuses on the development of computational tools and methods to explore age-related epigenomic signatures in fully characterised and phenotypically screened in vitro tumour models. These models include gene essentiality profiles derived from systematic CRISPR screens and drug response data.

## Fields
**Epigenomics:** Analysis of methylation data
**In-Vitro Models:** Analysys of cancer cell lines data
**CRISPR Screening:** Study of genetic dependencies via systematic CRISPR screens
**Drug Response:** Study of differential drug responses 

## Current Status
At this stage, the data and results of this research are confidential. The complete repository, including code and datasets, will be released once the project reaches its final phase.
